<div class="block">The AuralAttributes object is a component object of a Soundscape node that
 defines environmental audio parameters that affect sound rendering. These
 attributes include gain scale factor, atmospheric rolloff, and parameters
 controlling reverberation, distance frequency filtering, and velocity-based
 Doppler effect.
<P>
 Attribute Gain
   <P><UL>
    Scale factor applied to all sound's amplitude active within this region.
    This factor attenuates both direct and reflected/reverbered amplitudes.
    Valid values are >= 0.0
  </UL>
<P>
 Attribute Gain Rolloff
   <P><UL>
    Rolloff scale factor is used to model atmospheric changes from normal
    speed of sound.  The base value, 0.344 meters/millisecond is used
    to approximate the speed of sound through air at room temperature,
    is multipled by this scale factor whenever the speed of sound is
    applied during spatialization calculations.
    Valid values are >= 0.0.  Values > 1.0 increase the speed of sound,
    while values < 1.0 decrease its speed. A value of zero makes sound
    silent (but it continues to play).
   </UL>
<P>
 Auralization <P>
<UL>
    Auralization is the environmental modeling of sound iteratively
    reflecting off the surfaces of the bounded region the listener is in.
    Auralization components include
    early, distinct, low-order reflections and later, dense,
    higher-order reflections referred to as reverberation.
    These reflections are attenuated relative to the direct, unreflected
    sound.  The difference in gain between direct and reflected sound
    gives the listener a sense of the surface material and
    the relative distance of the sound.
    The delay between the start of the direct sound and start of
    reverberation (as detected by the listener),
    as well as the length of time reverberation is audible as it
    exponentially decays, give the listener a sense of the size of the
    listening space.
   <P>
    In Java3D's model for auralization there are several parameters
    that approximate sound reflection and reverberation for a particular
    listening space:
     <UL>Reflection Coefficient  <UL>Gain attenuation of the initial
         reflections across all frequencies.</UL></UL>
     <UL>(Early) Reflection Delay  <UL>The time it takes for the first
         low-order reflected sound to reach the listener.</UL></UL>
     <UL>Reverb Coefficient  <UL>Gain attenuation of the late reflections
         (referred to as 'reverb') across all frequencies.</UL></UL>
     <UL>Reverb Delay  <UL>The time it takes for reverbered sound
         to reach the listener.</UL></UL>
     <UL>Decay Time <UL>Describes the reverb decay curve by defining the
         length of time reverb takes to decay to effective zero.
         </UL></UL>
     <UL>Decay Filter  <UL>High-frequencies of the late reverberation
         can be attenuated at a different rate. </UL></UL>
     <UL>Density  <UL>Modal density (spectral coloration) of
         reverberation.</UL></UL>
     <UL>Diffusion  <UL>Echo dispersement of reverberation.</UL></UL>
     <UL>Reverb Bounds  <UL>Approximates the volume of the listening space.
         If specified, it defines the reverberation delay.</UL></UL>
     <UL>Reverb Order  <UL>Optionally limits the amount of times during
         reverb calculation that a sound is recursively reflected off the
         bounding region.</UL></UL>
   <P>
    Reflection Coefficient
   <P><UL>
       The reflection coefficient is an amplitude scale factor used to
       approximate the average reflective or absorptive characteristics
       for early reflections
       of the composite surfaces in the region the listener is in.
       This scale factor is applied to the sound's amplitude regardless of the
       sound's position.
       The range of valid values is 0.0 to 1.0.
       A value of 1.0 denotes that reflections are unattenuated -
       the amplitude of reflected sound waves are not decreased.
       A value of 0.0 represents full absorption of reflections
       by the surfaces in the listening space (no reflections occur
       thus reverberation is disabled).
     </UL>
   <P>
    Reflection Delay
   <P><UL>
       The early reflection delay time (in milliseconds) can be explicitly
       set.  Well-defined values are floats > 0.0.
       A value of 0.0 results in reverberation being added as soon as
       possible after the sound begins.
     </UL>
   <P>
    Reverberation Coefficient
   <P><UL>
       The reverb coefficient is an amplitude scale factor used to
       approximate the average reflective or absorptive characteristics
       of late reflections.
       A value of 0.0 represents full absorption of reflections
       by the surfaces in the listening space (no reflections occur
       thus reverberation is disabled).
     </UL>
   <P>
    Reverberation Delay
   <P><UL>
       The reverb delay time (in milliseconds) is set either explicitly,
       or implicitly by supplying a reverb bounds volume (from which the
       delay time can be calculated).  Well-defined values are floats > 0.0.
       A value of 0.0 results in reverberation being added as soon as
       possible after the sound begins.  Reverb delay, as calculated from non-
       null reverb bounds, takes precedence over explicitly set delay time.
     </UL>
   <P>
    Reverberation Bounds
   <P><UL>
       The reverb bounding region defines the overall size of space
       that reverberation is calculated for.
       This optional bounds does not have to be the same as the application
       region of the Soundscape node referencing this AuralAttributes object.
       If this bounding region is specified then reverb decay and delay are
       internally calculated from this bounds.
     </UL>
   <P>
    Reverberation Order
   <P><UL>
       The reverb order is a hint that can be used during reverberation
       to limit the number of late reflections required in calculation of
       reverb decay.
       All positive values can be interpreted during reverb rendering
       as the maximum order of reflections to be calculated.
       A non-positive value signifies that no limit is placed on the order of
       reflections calculated during reverberation rendering.
       In the case where reverb order is not limited, reverb decay is defined
       strictly by the Reverberation Decay Time parameter.
     </UL>
   <P>
    Decay Time
   <P><UL>
       The reverberation decay time explicitly defines the length of time in
       milliseconds it takes for the amplitude of late reflections to
       exponentally decrease to effective zero.
       In the case where reverb delay is set non-positive
       the renderer will perform the shortest reverberation decay
       possible.
       If ReverbOrder is set, this parameter is clamped by the reverb
       time calculated as time = reverb Delay * reverb Order.
       If ReverbOrder is 0, the decay time parameter is not clamped.
     </UL>
   <P>
    Decay Filter
   <P><UL>
       The reverberation decay filter defines how frequencies above a given
       value are attenuated by the listening space.  This allows for modelling
       materials on surfaces that absorb high frequencies at a faster rate
       than low frequencies.
     </UL>
   <P>
    Reverberation Diffusion
   <P><UL>
       The reverberation diffusion explicitly defines echo dispersement
       (sometimes refered to as echo density).  The value for diffusion
       is proportional to the number of echos per second heard in late
       reverberation, especially noticable at the tail of the reverberation
       decay.  The greater the diffusion the more 'natural' the reverberation
       decay sounds.  Reducing diffusion makes the decay sound hollow as
       produced in a small highly reflecive space (such as a bathroom).
     </UL>
   <P>
    Reverberation Density
   <P><UL>
       The reverberation density explicitly defines modal reverb density
       The value for this modal density is proportional to the number of
       resonances heard in late reverberation perceived as spectral
       coloration.  The greater the density, the smoother, less grainy the
       later reverberation decay.
     </UL>
</UL>
<P>
 Distance Filter
   <P><UL>
  This parameter specifies a (distance, filter) attenuation pairs array.
  If this is not set, no distance filtering is performed (equivalent to
  using a distance filter of Sound.NO_FILTER for all distances). Currently,
  this filter is a low-pass cutoff frequency. This array of pairs defines
  a piece-wise linear slope for range of values. This attenuation array is
  similar to the PointSound node's distanceAttenuation pair array, except
  paired with distances in this list are frequency values.  Using these
  pairs, distance-based low-pass frequency filtering can be applied during
  sound rendering. Distances, specified in the local coordinate system in
  meters, must be > 0. Frequencies (in Hz) must be > 0.
<P>
  If the distance from the listener to the sound source is less than the
  first distance in the array, the first filter is applied to the sound
  source.  This creates a spherical region around the listener within
  which a sound is uniformly attenuated by the first filter in the array.
  If the distance from the listener to the sound source is greater than
  the last distance in the array, the last filter is applied to the sound
  source.
   <P>
  Distance elements in these array of pairs is a monotonically-increasing
  set of floating point numbers measured from the location of the sound
  source.  FrequencyCutoff elements in this list of pairs can be any
  positive float. While for most applications this list of values will
  usually be monotonically-decreasing, they do not have to be.
   <P>
  The getDistanceFilterLength method returns the length of the distance filter
  arrays. Arrays passed into getDistanceFilter methods should all be at
  least this size.</UL>
   </UL><P>
  Doppler Effect Model
   <P><UL>
  Doppler effect can be used to create a greater sense of movement of
  sound sources, and can help reduce front-back localization errors.
  The frequency of sound waves emanating from the source are raised or
  lowered based on the speed of the source in relation to the listener,
  and several AuralAttribute parameters.
   <P>
  The FrequencyScaleFactor can be used to increase or reduce the change
  of frequency associated with normal Doppler calculation, or to shift
  the pitch of the sound directly if Doppler effect is disabled.
  Values must be > zero for sounds to be heard.  If the value is zero,
  sounds affected by this AuralAttribute object are paused.
   <P>
  To simulate Doppler effect, the relative velocity (change in
  distance in the local coordinate system between the sound source and
  the listener over time, in meters per second) is calculated. This
  calculated velocity is multipled by the given VelocityScaleFactor.
  Values must be >= zero.  If is a scale factor value of zero is given,
  Doppler effect is not calculated or applied to sound.</UL></UL></div>
