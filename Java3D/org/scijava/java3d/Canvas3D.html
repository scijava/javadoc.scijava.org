<div class="block">The Canvas3D class provides a drawing canvas for 3D rendering.  It
 is used either for on-screen rendering or off-screen rendering.
 Canvas3D is an extension of the AWT Canvas class that users may
 further subclass to implement additional functionality.
 <p>
 The Canvas3D object extends the Canvas object to include
 3D-related information such as the size of the canvas in pixels,
 the Canvas3D's location, also in pixels, within a Screen3D object,
 and whether or not the canvas has stereo enabled.
 <p>
 Because all Canvas3D objects contain a
 reference to a Screen3D object and because Screen3D objects define
 the size of a pixel in physical units, Java 3D can convert a Canvas3D
 size in pixels to a physical world size in meters. It can also
 determine the Canvas3D's position and orientation in the
 physical world.
 <p>
 <b>On-screen Rendering vs. Off-screen Rendering</b>
 <p>
 The Canvas3D class is used either for on-screen rendering or
 off-screen rendering.
 On-screen Canvas3Ds are added to AWT or Swing Container objects
 like any other canvas.  Java 3D automatically and continuously
 renders to all on-screen canvases that are attached to an active
 View object.  On-screen Canvas3Ds can be either single or double
 buffered and they can be either stereo or monoscopic.
 <p>
 Off-screen Canvas3Ds must not be added to any Container.  Java 3D
 renders to off-screen canvases in response to the
 <code>renderOffScreenBuffer</code> method.  Off-screen Canvas3Ds
 are single buffered.  However, on many systems, the actual
 rendering is done to an off-screen hardware buffer or to a 3D
 library-specific buffer and only copied to the off-screen buffer of
 the Canvas when the rendering is complete, at "buffer swap" time.
 Off-screen Canvas3Ds are monoscopic.
 <p>
 The setOffScreenBuffer method sets the off-screen buffer for this
 Canvas3D. The specified image is written into by the Java 3D renderer.
 The size of the specified ImageComponent determines the size, in
 pixels, of this Canvas3D - the size inherited from Component is
 ignored. Note that the size, physical width, and physical height of the
 associated Screen3D must be set
 explicitly prior to rendering. Failure to do so will result in an
 exception.
 <p>
 The getOffScreenBuffer method retrieves the off-screen
 buffer for this Canvas3D.
 <p>
 The renderOffScreenBuffer method schedules the rendering of a frame
 into this Canvas3D's off-screen buffer. The rendering is done from
 the point of view of the View object to which this Canvas3D has been
 added. No rendering is performed if this Canvas3D object has not been
 added to an active View. This method does not wait for the rendering
 to actually happen. An application that wishes to know when the
 rendering is complete must either subclass Canvas3D and
 override the postSwap method, or call waitForOffScreenRendering.
 <p>
 The setOfScreenLocation methods set the location of this off-screen
 Canvas3D.  The location is the upper-left corner of the Canvas3D
 relative to the upper-left corner of the corresponding off-screen
 Screen3D. The function of these methods is similar to that of
 Component.setLocation for on-screen Canvas3D objects. The default
 location is (0,0).
 <p>
 <b>Accessing and Modifying an Eye's Image Plate Position</b>
 <p>
 A Canvas3D object provides sophisticated applications with access
 to the eye's position information in head-tracked, room-mounted
 runtime environments. It also allows applications to manipulate
 the position of an eye relative to an image plate in non-head-tracked
 runtime environments.
 <p>
 The setLeftManualEyeInImagePlate and setRightManualEyeInImagePlate
 methods set the position of the manual left and right eyes in image
 plate coordinates. These values determine eye placement when a head
 tracker is not in use and the application is directly controlling the
 eye position in image plate coordinates. In head-tracked mode or
 when the windowEyepointPolicy is RELATIVE_TO_FIELD_OF_VIEW or
 RELATIVE_TO_COEXISTENCE, this
 value is ignored. When the windowEyepointPolicy is RELATIVE_TO_WINDOW,
 only the Z value is used.
 <p>
 The getLeftEyeInImagePlate, getRightEyeInImagePlate, and
 getCenterEyeInImagePlate methods retrieve the actual position of the
 left eye, right eye, and center eye in image plate coordinates and
 copy that value into the object provided. The center eye is the
 fictional eye half-way between the left and right eye. These three
 values are a function of the windowEyepointPolicy, the tracking
 enable flag, and the manual left, right, and center eye positions.
 <p>
 <b>Monoscopic View Policy</b>
 <p>
 The setMonoscopicViewPolicy and getMonoscopicViewPolicy methods
 set and retrieve the policy regarding how Java 3D generates monoscopic
 view. If the policy is set to View.LEFT_EYE_VIEW, the view generated
 corresponds to the view as seen from the left eye. If set to
 View.RIGHT_EYE_VIEW, the view generated corresponds to the view as
 seen from the right eye. If set to View.CYCLOPEAN_EYE_VIEW, the view
 generated corresponds to the view as seen from the "center eye," the
 fictional eye half-way between the left and right eye. The default
 monoscopic view policy is View.CYCLOPEAN_EYE_VIEW.
 <p>
 <b>Immediate Mode Rendering</b>
 <p>
 Pure immediate-mode rendering provides for those applications and
 applets that do not want Java 3D to do any automatic rendering of
 the scene graph. Such applications may not even wish to build a
 scene graph to represent their graphical data. However, they use
 Java 3D's attribute objects to set graphics state and Java 3D's
 geometric objects to render geometry.
 <p>
 A pure immediate mode application must create a minimal set of
 Java 3D objects before rendering. In addition to a Canvas3D object,
 the application must create a View object, with its associated
 PhysicalBody and PhysicalEnvironment objects, and the following
 scene graph elements: a VirtualUniverse object, a high-resolution
 Locale object, a BranchGroup node object, a TransformGroup node
 object with associated transform, and a ViewPlatform
 leaf node object that defines the position and orientation within
 the virtual universe that generates the view.
 <p>
 In immediate mode, all rendering is done completely under user
 control. It is necessary for the user to clear the 3D canvas,
 render all geometry, and swap the buffers.  Additionally,
 rendering the right and left eye for stereo viewing becomes the
 sole responsibility of the application.  In pure immediate mode,
 the user must stop the Java 3D renderer, via the
 Canvas3D object <code>stopRenderer</code> method, prior to adding the
 Canvas3D object to an active View object (that is, one that is
 attached to a live ViewPlatform object).
 <p>
 Other Canvas3D methods related to immediate mode rendering are:
 <p>
 <ul>
 <code>getGraphicsContext3D</code> retrieves the immediate-mode
 3D graphics context associated with this Canvas3D. It creates a
 new graphics context if one does not already exist.
 <p>
 <code>getGraphics2D</code> retrieves the
 2D graphics object associated with this Canvas3D. It creates a
 new 2D graphics object if one does not already exist.
 <p>
 <code>swap</code> synchronizes and swaps buffers on a
 double-buffered canvas for this Canvas3D object. This method
 should only be called if the Java 3D renderer has been stopped.
 In the normal case, the renderer automatically swaps
 the buffer.
 </ul>

 <p>
 <b>Mixed Mode Rendering</b>
 <p>
 Mixing immediate mode and retained or compiled-retained mode
 requires more structure than pure immediate mode. In mixed mode,
 the Java 3D renderer is running continuously, rendering the scene
 graph into the canvas.

 <p>
 Canvas3D methods related to mixed mode rendering are:

 <p>
 <ul>
 <code>preRender</code> called by the Java 3D rendering loop after
 clearing the canvas and before any rendering has been done for
 this frame.
 <p>
 <code>postRender</code> called by the Java 3D rendering loop after
 completing all rendering to the canvas for this frame and before
 the buffer swap.
 <p>
 <code>postSwap</code> called by the Java 3D rendering loop after
 completing all rendering to the canvas, and all other canvases
 associated with this view, for this frame following the
 buffer swap.
 <p>
 <code>renderField</code> called by the Java 3D rendering loop
 during the execution of the rendering loop. It is called once
 for each field (i.e., once per frame on a mono system or once
 each for the right eye and left eye on a two-pass stereo system.
 </ul>
 <p>
 The above callback methods are called by the Java 3D rendering system
 and should <i>not</i> be called by an application directly.

 <p>
 The basic Java 3D <i>stereo</i> rendering loop,
 executed for each Canvas3D, is as follows:
 <ul><pre>
 clear canvas (both eyes)
 call preRender()                           // user-supplied method
 set left eye view
 render opaque scene graph objects
 call renderField(FIELD_LEFT)               // user-supplied method
 render transparent scene graph objects
 set right eye view
 render opaque scene graph objects again
 call renderField(FIELD_RIGHT)              // user-supplied method
 render transparent scene graph objects again
 call postRender()                          // user-supplied method
 synchronize and swap buffers
 call postSwap()                            // user-supplied method
 </pre></ul>
 <p>
 The basic Java 3D <i>monoscopic</i> rendering loop is as follows:
 <ul><pre>
 clear canvas
 call preRender()                            // user-supplied method
 set view
 render opaque scene graph objects
 call renderField(FIELD_ALL)                 // user-supplied method
 render transparent scene graph objects
 call postRender()                           // user-supplied method
 synchronize and swap buffers
 call postSwap()                             // user-supplied method
 </pre></ul>
 <p>
 In both cases, the entire loop, beginning with clearing the canvas
 and ending with swapping the buffers, defines a frame. The application
 is given the opportunity to render immediate-mode geometry at any of
 the clearly identified spots in the rendering loop. A user specifies
 his or her own rendering methods by extending the Canvas3D class and
 overriding the preRender, postRender, postSwap, and/or renderField
 methods.
 Updates to live Geometry, Texture, and ImageComponent objects
 in the scene graph are not allowed from any of these callback
 methods.

 <p>
 <b>Serialization</b>
 <p>
 Canvas3D does <i>not</i> support serialization.  An attempt to
 serialize a Canvas3D object will result in an
 UnsupportedOperationException being thrown.

 <p>
 The descriptions of the values returned for each key are as follows:

 <p>
 <ul>
 <li>
 <code>shadingLanguageCg</code>
 <ul>
 A Boolean indicating whether or not Cg shading Language
 is available for this Canvas3D.
 </ul>
 </li>

 <li>
 <code>shadingLanguageGLSL</code>
 <ul>
 A Boolean indicating whether or not GLSL shading Language
 is available for this Canvas3D.
 </ul>
 </li>

 <li>
 <code>doubleBufferAvailable</code>
 <ul>
 A Boolean indicating whether or not double buffering
 is available for this Canvas3D.  This is equivalent to
 the getDoubleBufferAvailable method.  If this flag is false,
 the Canvas3D will be rendered in single buffer mode; requests
 to enable double buffering will be ignored.
 </ul>
 </li>

 <li>
 <code>stereoAvailable</code>
 <ul>
 A Boolean indicating whether or not stereo
 is available for this Canvas3D.  This is equivalent to
 the getStereoAvailable method.  If this flag is false,
 the Canvas3D will be rendered in monoscopic mode; requests
 to enable stereo will be ignored.
 </ul>
 </li>

 <li>
 <code>sceneAntialiasingAvailable</code>
 <ul>
 A Boolean indicating whether or not scene antialiasing
 is available for this Canvas3D.  This is equivalent to
 the getSceneAntialiasingAvailable method.  If this flag is false,
 requests to enable scene antialiasing will be ignored.
 </ul>
 </li>

 <li>
 <code>sceneAntialiasingNumPasses</code>
 <ul>
 An Integer indicating the number of passes scene antialiasing
 requires to render a single frame for this Canvas3D.
 If this value is zero, scene antialiasing is not supported.
 If this value is one, multisampling antialiasing is used.
 Otherwise, the number indicates the number of rendering passes
 needed.
 </ul>
 </li>

 <li>
 <code>stencilSize</code>
 <ul>
 An Integer indicating the number of stencil bits that are available
 for this Canvas3D.
 </ul>
 </li>

 <li>
 <code>texture3DAvailable</code>
 <ul>
 A Boolean indicating whether or not 3D Texture mapping
 is available for this Canvas3D.  If this flag is false,
 3D texture mapping is either not supported by the underlying
 rendering layer or is otherwise unavailable for this
 particular Canvas3D.  All use of 3D texture mapping will be
 ignored in this case.
 </ul>
 </li>

 <li>
 <code>textureColorTableSize</code>
 <ul>
 An Integer indicating the maximum size of the texture color
 table for this Canvas3D.  If the size is 0, the texture
 color table is either not supported by the underlying rendering
 layer or is otherwise unavailable for this particular
 Canvas3D.  An attempt to use a texture color table larger than
 textureColorTableSize will be ignored; no color lookup will be
 performed.
 </ul>
 </li>

 <li>
 <code>textureLodRangeAvailable</code>
 <ul>
 A Boolean indicating whether or not setting only a subset of mipmap
 levels and setting a range of texture LOD are available for this
 Canvas3D.
 If it indicates false, setting a subset of mipmap levels and
 setting a texture LOD range are not supported by the underlying
 rendering layer, and an attempt to set base level, or maximum level,
 or minimum LOD, or maximum LOD will be ignored. In this case,
 images for all mipmap levels must be defined for the texture to be
 valid.
 </ul>
 </li>

 <li>
 <code>textureLodOffsetAvailable</code>
 <ul>
 A Boolean indicating whether or not setting texture LOD offset is
 available for this Canvas3D. If it indicates false, setting
 texture LOD offset is not supported by the underlying rendering
 layer, and an attempt to set the texture LOD offset will be ignored.
 </ul>
 </li>

 <li>
 <code>textureWidthMax</code>
 <ul>
 An Integer indicating the maximum texture width supported by
 this Canvas3D. If the width of a texture exceeds the maximum texture
 width for a Canvas3D, then the texture will be effectively disabled
 for that Canvas3D.
 </ul>
 </li>

 <li>
 <code>textureHeightMax</code>
 <ul>
 An Integer indicating the maximum texture height supported by
 this Canvas3D. If the height of a texture exceeds the maximum texture
 height for a Canvas3D, then the texture will be effectively disabled
 for that Canvas3D.
 </ul>
 </li>

 <li>
 <code>textureBoundaryWidthMax</code>
 <ul>
 An Integer indicating the maximum texture boundary width
 supported by the underlying rendering layer for this Canvas3D. If
 the maximum supported texture boundary width is 0, then texture
 boundary is not supported by the underlying rendering layer.
 An attempt to specify a texture boundary width > the
 textureBoundaryWidthMax will effectively disable the texture.
 </ul>
 </li>

 <li>
 <code>textureEnvCombineAvailable</code>
 <ul>
 A Boolean indicating whether or not texture environment combine
 operation is supported for this Canvas3D. If it indicates false,
 then texture environment combine is not supported by the
 underlying rendering layer, and an attempt to specify COMBINE
 as the texture mode will be ignored. The texture mode in effect
 will be REPLACE.
 </ul>
 </li>

 <li>
 <code>textureCombineDot3Available</code>
 <ul>
 A Boolean indicating whether or not texture combine mode
 COMBINE_DOT3 is
 supported for this Canvas3D. If it indicates false, then
 texture combine mode COMBINE_DOT3 is not supported by
 the underlying rendering layer, and an attempt to specify
 COMBINE_DOT3 as the texture combine mode will be ignored.
 The texture combine mode in effect will be COMBINE_REPLACE.
 </ul>
 </li>

 <li>
 <code>textureCombineSubtractAvailable</code>
 <ul>
 A Boolean indicating whether or not texture combine mode
 COMBINE_SUBTRACT is
 supported for this Canvas3D. If it indicates false, then
 texture combine mode COMBINE_SUBTRACT is not supported by
 the underlying rendering layer, and an attempt to specify
 COMBINE_SUBTRACT as the texture combine mode will be ignored.
 The texture combine mode in effect will be COMBINE_REPLACE.
 </ul>
 </li>

 <li>
 <code>textureCoordSetsMax</code>
 <ul>
 An Integer indicating the maximum number of texture coordinate sets
 supported by the underlying rendering layer.
 </ul>
 </li>

 <li>
 <code>textureUnitStateMax</code>
 <ul>
 An Integer indicating the maximum number of fixed-function texture units
 supported by the underlying rendering layer. If the number of
 application-sepcified texture unit states exceeds the maximum number
 for a Canvas3D, and the fixed-function rendering pipeline is used, then
 the texture will be effectively disabled for that Canvas3D.
 </ul>
 </li>

 <li>
 <code>textureImageUnitsMax</code>
 <ul>
 An Integer indicating the maximum number of texture image units
 that can be accessed by the fragment shader when programmable shaders
 are used.
 </ul>
 </li>

 <li>
 <code>textureImageUnitsVertexMax</code>
 <ul>
 An Integer indicating the maximum number of texture image units
 that can be accessed by the vertex shader when programmable shaders
 are used.
 </ul>
 </li>

 <li>
 <code>textureImageUnitsCombinedMax</code>
 <ul>
 An Integer indicating the combined maximum number of texture image units
 that can be accessed by the vertex shader and the fragment shader when
 programmable shaders are used.
 </ul>
 </li>

 <li>
 <code>textureCubeMapAvailable</code>
 <ul>
 A Boolean indicating whether or not texture cube map is supported
 for this Canvas3D. If it indicates false, then texture cube map
 is not supported by the underlying rendering layer, and an attempt
 to specify NORMAL_MAP or REFLECTION_MAP as the texture generation
 mode will be ignored. The texture generation mode in effect will
 be SPHERE_MAP.
 </ul>
 </li>

 <li>
 <code>textureDetailAvailable</code>
 <ul>
 A Boolean indicating whether or not detail texture is supported
 for this Canvas3D. If it indicates false, then detail texture is
 not supported by the underlying rendering layer, and an attempt
 to specify LINEAR_DETAIL, LINEAR_DETAIL_ALPHA or
 LINEAR_DETAIL_RGB as the texture magnification filter mode will
 be ignored. The texture magnification filter mode in effect will
 be BASE_LEVEL_LINEAR.
 As of Java 3D 1.5, this property is always false.
 </ul>
 </li>

 <li>
 <code>textureSharpenAvailable</code>
 <ul>
 A Boolean indicating whether or not sharpen texture is supported
 for this Canvas3D. If it indicates false, then sharpen texture
 is not supported by the underlying rendering layer, and an attempt
 to specify LINEAR_SHARPEN, LINEAR_SHARPEN_ALPHA or
 LINEAR_SHARPEN_RGB as the texture magnification filter mode
 will be ignored. The texture magnification filter mode in effect
 will be BASE_LEVEL_LINEAR.
 </ul>
 </li>

 <li>
 <code>textureFilter4Available</code>
 <ul>
 A Boolean indicating whether or not filter4 is supported for this
 Canvas3D. If it indicates flase, then filter4 is not supported
 by the underlying rendering layer, and an attempt to specify
 FILTER_4 as the texture minification filter mode or texture
 magnification filter mode will be ignored. The texture filter mode
 in effect will be BASE_LEVEL_LINEAR.
 </ul>
 </li>

 <li>
 <code>textureAnisotropicFilterDegreeMax</code>
 <ul>
 A Float indicating the maximum degree of anisotropic filter
 available for this Canvas3D. If it indicates 1.0, setting
 anisotropic filter is not supported by the underlying rendering
 layer, and an attempt to set anisotropic filter degree will be ignored.
 </ul>
 </li>

 <li>
 <code>textureNonPowerOfTwoAvailable</code>
 <ul>
 A Boolean indicating whether or not texture dimensions that are
 not powers of two are supported for
 for this Canvas3D. If it indicates false, then textures with
 non power of two sizes will be ignored. Set the property
 j3d.textureEnforcePowerOfTwo to revert to the pre-1.5 behavior
 of throwing exceptions for non power of two textures.
 </ul>
 </li>

 <li>
 <code>vertexAttrsMax</code>
 <ul>
 An Integer indicating the maximum number of vertex attributes
 supported by the underlying rendering layer. This is in addition to
 the vertex coordinate (position), color, normal, and so forth.
 </ul>
 </li>

 <li>
 <code>compressedGeometry.majorVersionNumber</code><br>
 <code>compressedGeometry.minorVersionNumber</code><br>
 <code>compressedGeometry.minorMinorVersionNumber</code>
 <ul>
 Integers indicating the major, minor, and minor-minor
 version numbers, respectively, of the version of compressed
 geometry supported by this version of Java 3D.
 </ul>
 </li>

 <li>
 <code>native.version</code>
 <ul>
 A String indicating the version number of the native graphics
 library.  The format of this string is defined by the native
 library.
