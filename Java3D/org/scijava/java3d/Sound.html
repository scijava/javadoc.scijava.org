<div class="block">Sound node is an abstract class that defines the properties common to all
 sound sources. A scene graph can contain multiple sounds. Associated with each
 sound source are: a reference to sound data, an amplitude scale factor, a release
 flag denoting that the sound associated with this node is to play to end when
 it is disabled, the number of times sound is to be repeated, the sound's state
 (on or off), a scheduling region, and a flag denoting if the sound is to
 continue playing "silently" even while it is inactive. Whenever the listener
 is within a sound node's scheduling bounds this sound is potentially audible.
<P>
 Sound Data

 <UL>Associated with each Sound node is a MediaContainer
 which includes audio data and information about this data.
 This data can be cached (buffered) or non-cached (unbuffered or streaming).
 If an AudioDevice has been attached to the PhysicalEnvironment, the sound
 data is made ready to begin playing.
 Certain functionality can not be applied to true streaming sound data:<p>
 1) querying the sound's duration (Sound.DURATION_UNKNOWN will be returned),<br>
 2) looping over a range of the streaming data; and<br>
 3) restart a previously played portion of the data.<p>
 Depending on the implementation of the AudioDevice used, streamed, non-
 cached data may not be fully spatialized.</UL>
<P>
 Initial Gain

 <UL>This gain is a scale factor applied to the sound data associated
 with this sound source to increase or decrease its overall amplitude.</UL>
<P>
 Loop

 <UL>Data for non-streaming sound (such as a sound sample) can contain two
 loop points marking a section of the data that is to be looped a specific
 number of times. Thus sound data can be divided into three segments:
 the attack (before the begin loop point), the sustain (between the begin
 and end loop points), and the release (after the end loop point). If
 there are no loop begin and end points defined as part of the sound data,
 the begin loop point is set at the beginning of the sound data,
 and the end loop point at the end of the sound data.
 If this is the case, looping the sound would mean repeating the whole
 sound. However, these allow a portion in the middle of the sound to
 be looped.
<P>
 A sound can be looped a specified number of times after it is activated
 before it is completed. The loop count value explicitly sets the number
 of times the sound is looped. Any non-negative number is a valid value.
 A value of zero denotes that the looped section is not repeated, but is
 played only once. A value of -1 denotes that the loop is repeated
 indefinitely.
<P>
 Changing loop count of a sound after the sound has been started will not
 dynamically affect the loop count currently used by the sound playing.
 The new loop count will be used the next time the sound is enabled.</UL>
 <P>
 Release Flag

 <UL>When a sound is disabled, its playback would normally stop immediately
 no matter what part of the sound data was currently being played. By
 setting the Release Flag to true for nodes with non-streaming sound data,
 the sound is allowed to play from its current position in the sound data
 to the end of the data (without repeats), thus playing the release portion
 of the sound before stopping.</UL>
<P>
 Continuous Flag

 <UL>For some applications, it's useful to turn a sound source "off" but to
 continue "silently" playing the sound so that when it is turned back "on"
 the sound picks up playing in the same location (over time) as it would
 have been if the sound had never been disabled (turned off). Setting the
 Continuous flag true causes the sound renderer to keep track of where
 (over time) the sound would be playing even when the sound is disabled.</UL>
<P>
  Enable Sound

 <UL>When enabled, the sound source is started
 playing and thus can potentially be heard, depending on its activation
 state, gain control parameters, continuation state, and spatialization
 parameters.  If the continuous state is true, even if the sound is not
 active, enabling the sound starts the sound silently "playing," so that
 when the sound is activated, the sound is (potentially) heard from
 somewhere in the middle of the sound data. Activation state can change
 from active to inactive any number of times without stopping or starting
 the sound. To re-start a sound at the beginning of its data, re-enable
 the sound by calling setEnable with true.
<P>
 Setting the enable flag to true during construction acts as a request
 to start the sound playing "as soon as it can" be started.
 This could be close to immediately in limited cases, but several conditions,
 detailed below, must be met for a sound to be ready to be played.</UL>
<P>
  Mute Sound

 <UL>When the mute state is set true, a playing sound is made to play silently.
</UL><P>
  Pause Sound

 <UL>When the pause state is set true, a playing sound is paused.
<P>
 Setting the enable flag to true during construction acts as a request
 to start the sound playing "as soon as it can" be started.
 This could be close to immediately in limited cases, but several conditions,
 detailed below, must be met for a sound to be ready to be played.</UL>
   <P>
  Scheduling Bounds

 <UL>
 A Sound is scheduled for activation when its scheduling region intersects
 the ViewPlatform's activation volume. This is used when the scheduling
 bounding leaf is set to null.</UL>
<P>
 Scheduling Bounding Leaf

 <UL>When set to a value other than null, the scheduling bounding leaf
 region overrides the scheduling bounds
 object.</UL>
<P>
  Prioritize Sound

 <UL>Sound Priority is used
 to rank concurrently playing sounds in order of importance during playback.
 When more sounds are started than the AudioDevice
 can handle, the sound node with the lowest priority ranking is
 deactivated (but continues playing silently). If a sound is deactivated
 (due to a sound with a higher
 priority being started), it is automatically re-activated when
 resources become available (e.g., when a sound with a higher priority
 finishes playing), or when the ordering of sound nodes are changed due to
 a change in a sound node's priority.
 <P>
 Sounds with a lower priority than sound that can
 not be played due to lack of channels will be played.
 For example, assume we have eight channels available for playing sounds.
 After ordering four sounds, we begin playing them in order, checking if
 the number of channels required to play a given sound are actually available
 before the sound is played.  Furthermore, say the first sound needs three
 channels
 to play, the second sound needs four channels, the third sound needs three
 channels
 and the fourth sound needs only one channel.  The first and second sounds
 can be started because they require seven of the eight available channels.  The
 third sound can not be audibly started because it requires three channels and
 only one is still available.  Consequently, the third sound starts playing
 'silently.' The fourth sound can and will be started since it only requires
 one channel.  The third sound will be made audible when three channels become
 available (i.e., when the first or second sound finishes playing).
 <P>
 Sounds given the same priority are ordered randomly. If the application
 wants a specific ordering, it must assign unique priorities to each sound.
 <P>
 Methods to determine what audio output resources are required for playing
 a Sound node on a particular AudioDevice and to determine the currently
 available audio output resources are described in the AudioDevice class.</UL>
   <P>
 Duration

 <UL>Each sound has a length of time in milliseconds that it
 can run (including repeating loop section)
 if it plays to completion. If the sound
 media type is streaming, or if the sound is looped indefinitely, then a
 value of -1 (implying infinite length) is returned.</UL>
<P>
 Number of Channels used on Audio Device to Play Sound

 <UL>When a sound is started, it could use more than one channel on the
 selected AudioDevice it is to be played on.  The number of Audio Device
 channels currently used for a sound can be queried using
 getNumberOfChannelsUsed().</UL>
<P>
 Preparing a Sound to be Played

 <UL>Sound data associated with a Sound node, either during construction
 (when the MediaContainer is passed into the constructor as a parameter)
 or by calling setSoundData(), it can be prepared to begin playing
 only after the following conditions are satisfied:<p>
 1) the Sound node has non-null sound data associated with it<br>
 2) the Sound node is live<br>
 3) there is an active View in the Universe and<br>
 4) there is an initialized AudioDevice associated with the
 PhysicalEnvironment.<p>
 Depending on the type of MediaContainer the sound data is and on the
 implementation of the AudioDevice used, sound data preparation could consist
 of opening, attaching, loading, or copying into memory the associated sound data.
 The query method, isReady() returns true when the sound is fully preprocessed
 so that it is playable (audibly if active, silently if not active).</UL>
<P>
 Playing Status

 <UL>A sound source will not be heard unless it is:<p>
 1) enabled/started<br>
 2) activated<br>
 3) not muted<br>
 4) not paused<p>
 While these conditions are meet, the sound is potentially audible
 and the method isPlaying() will return a status of true.
<P>
 isPlaying returns false but isPlayingSilently returns true if a sound:<p>
 1) is enabled before it is activated; it is begun playing silently.<br>
 2) is enabled then deactivated while playing; it continues playing silently<br>
 3) is enabled while it mute state is true
<P>
 When the sound finishes playing it's sound data (including all loops), it
 is implicitly disabled.</UL>
