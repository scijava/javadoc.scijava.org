<div class="block">The View object contains all parameters needed in rendering a
 three dimensional scene from one viewpoint.  A view contains a list
 of Canvas3D objects that the view is rendered into.  It exists outside
 of the scene graph, but attaches to a ViewPlatform leaf node object
 in the scene graph.  It also contains a reference to a PhysicalBody
 and a PhysicalEnvironment object.
 <P>
 The View object is the main Java 3D object for controlling the
 Java 3D viewing model. All of the components that specify the
 view transform used to render to the 3D canvases are either contained
 in the View object or in objects that are referenced by the View
 object.
 <P>
 Java 3D allows applications to specify multiple simultaneously active
 View objects, each controlling its own set of canvases.
 <P>
 The Java 3D View object has several instance variables and methods,
 but most are calibration variables or user-helping functions. The
 viewing policies defined by the View object are described below.
 <P>
 <b>Policies</b><P>

 The View object defines the following policies:<P>
 <UL>
 <LI>View policy - informs Java 3D whether it should generate
 the view using the head-tracked system of transformations or the
 head-mounted system of transformations. These policies are attached
 to the Java 3D View object. There are two view policies:</LI><P>
 <UL>
 <LI>SCREEN_VIEW - specifies that Java 3D should compute a new
 viewpoint using the sequence of transforms appropriate to screen-based
 head-tracked display environments (fish-tank VR/portals/VR-desks).
 This is the default setting.</LI><P>
 <LI>HMD_VIEW - specifies that Java 3D should compute a new viewpoint
 using the sequence of transforms appropriate to head mounted display
 environments. This policy is not available in compatibility mode
 (see the setCompatibilityModeEnable method description).</LI><P>
 </UL>
 <LI>Projection policy - specifies whether Java 3D should generate
 a parallel projection or a perspective projection. This policy
 is attached to the Java 3D View object. There are two projection
 policies:</LI><P>
 <UL>
 <LI>PARALLEL_PROJECTION - specifies that a parallel projection
 transform is computed.</LI><P>
 <LI>PERSPECTIVE_PROJECTION - specifies that a perspective projection
 transform is computed. This is the default policy.</LI><P>
 </UL>
 <LI>Screen scale policy - specifies where the screen scale comes from.
 There are two screen scale policies:</LI><P>
 <UL>
 <LI>SCALE_SCREEN_SIZE - specifies that the scale is derived from the
 physical screen according to the following formula (this is the
 default mode):</LI>
 <UL>
 <code>screenScale = physicalScreenWidth / 2.0</code><P>
 </UL>
 <LI>SCALE_EXPLICIT - pecifies that the scale is taken directly from
 the user-provided <code>screenScale</code> attribute (see the
 setScreenScale method description).</LI><P>
 </UL>
 <LI>Window resize policy - specifies how Java 3D modifies the view
 when users resize windows. When users resize or move windows,
 Java 3D can choose to think of the window as attached either to
 the physical world or to the virtual world. The window resize
 policy allows an application to specify how the
 view model will handle resizing requests.
 There are two window resize policies:</LI><P>
 <UL>
 <LI>VIRTUAL_WORLD - implies that the original image remains the
 same size on the screen but the user sees more or less of the
 virtual world depending on whether the window grew or shrank
 in size.</LI><P>
 <LI>PHYSICAL_WORLD - implies that the original image continues
 to fill the window in the same way using more or less pixels
 depending on whether the window grew or shrank in size.</LI><P>
 </UL>
 <LI>Window movement policy - specifies what part of the virtual
 world Java 3D draws as a function of window placement on the screen.
 There are two window movement policies:</LI><P>
 <UL>
 <LI>VIRTUAL_WORLD - implies that the image seen in the window
 changes as the position of the window shifts on the screen.
 (This mode acts as if the window were a window into the virtual
 world.)</LI><P>
 <LI>PHYSICAL_WORLD - implies that the image seen in the window
 remains the same no matter where the user positions the window
 on the screen.</LI><P>
 </UL>
 <LI>Window eyepoint policy - comes into effect in a non-head-tracked
 environment. The policy tells Java 3D how to construct a new view
 frustum based on changes in the field of view and in the Canvas3D's
 location on the screen. The policy only comes into effect when the
 application changes a parameter that can change the placement of the
 eyepoint relative to the view frustum.
 There are three window eyepoint policies:</LI><P>
 <UL>
 <LI>RELATIVE_TO_SCREEN - tells Java 3D to interpret the eye's position
 relative to the entire screen. No matter where an end user moves a
 window (a Canvas3D), Java 3D continues to interpret the eye's position
 relative to the screen. This implies that the view frustum changes shape
 whenever an end user moves the location of a window on the screen.
 In this mode, the field of view is read-only.</LI><P>
 <LI>RELATIVE_TO_WINDOW - specifies that Java 3D should interpret the
 eye's position information relative to the window (Canvas3D). No matter
 where an end user moves a window (a Canvas3D), Java 3D continues to
 interpret the eye's position relative to that window. This implies
 that the frustum remains the same no matter where the end user
 moves the window on the screen. In this mode, the field of view
 is read-only.</LI><P>
 <LI>RELATIVE_TO_FIELD_OF_VIEW - tells Java 3D that it should
 modify the eyepoint position so it is located at the appropriate
 place relative to the window to match the specified field of view.
 This implies that the view frustum will change whenever the
 application changes the field of view. In this mode, the eye
 position is read-only. This is the default setting.</LI><P>
 <LI>RELATIVE_TO_COEXISTENCE - tells Java 3D to interpret the eye's
 position in coexistence coordinates. In this mode, the eye position
 is taken from the view (rather than the Canvas3D) and transformed from
 coexistence coordinates to image plate coordinates for each
 Canvas3D.  The resulting eye position is relative to the screen. As
 in RELATIVE_TO_SCREEN mode, this implies that the view frustum
 changes shape whenever an end user moves the location of a window
 on the screen.  In this mode, the field of view is
 read-only.</LI><P>
 </UL>
 <LI>Front and back clip policies - specifies how Java 3D
 interprets clipping distances to both the near and far clip
 planes. The policies can contain one of four values specifying
 whether a distance measurement should be interpreted in
 the physical or the virtual world and whether that distance
 measurement should be interpreted relative to the physical
 eyepoint or the physical screen.
 The front and back clip policies
 are specified separately. The front clip policy determines
 where Java 3D places the front clipping plane. The back clip
 policy determines where Java 3D places the back clipping plane.
 The values for both front and back clipping planes are:</LI><P>
 <UL>
 <LI>VIRTUAL_EYE - specifies that the associated distance is from
 the eye and in units of virtual distance.</LI><P>
 <LI>PHYSICAL_EYE - specifies that the associated distance is from
 the eye and in units of physical distance (in meters).
 This is the default policy for both front and back clipping.</LI><P>
 <LI>VIRTUAL_SCREEN  - specifies that the associated distance is
 from the screen and in units of virtual distance. </LI><P>
 <LI>PHYSICAL_SCREEN - specifies that the associated distance is
 from the screen and in units of physical distance (in meters).
 </LI><P>
 </UL>
 <LI>Visibility policy - specifies how visible and invisible objects
 are drawn. There are three visibility policies:</LI><P>
 <UL>
 <LI>VISIBILITY_DRAW_VISIBLE - only visible objects are drawn
 (this is the default).</LI><P>
 <LI>VISIBILITY_DRAW_INVISIBLE - only invisible objects are drawn.</LI><P>
 <LI>VISIBILITY_DRAW_ALL - both visible and invisible
 objects are drawn. </LI><P>
 </UL>
 <LI>Transparency sorting policy - specifies whether and how
 transparent objects are sorted.  Sorting multiple transparent
 objects is necessary to avoid artifacts caused by overlapping
 transparent objects.  There are two transparency sorting
 policies:</LI><P>
 <UL>
 <LI>TRANSPARENCY_SORT_NONE - no depth sorting of transparent
 objects is performed (this is the default).  Transparent objects
 are drawn after opaque objects, but are not sorted from back to
 front.</LI><P>
 <LI>TRANSPARENCY_SORT_GEOMETRY - transparent objects are
 depth-sorted on a per-geometry basis.  Each geometry object of each
 transparent Shape3D node is drawn from back to front.  Note that
 this policy will not split geometry into smaller pieces, so
 intersecting or intertwined objects may not be sorted
 correctly.  The method used for determining which geometry is closer
 is implementation dependent.</LI><P>
 </UL>
 </UL>
 <b>Projection and Clip Parameters</b><P>
 The projection and clip parameters determine the view model's
 field of view and the front and back clipping distances.<P>
 <UL>
 <LI>Field of view - specifies the view model's horizontal
 field of view in radians, when in the default non-head-tracked
 mode. This value is ignored when the view model is operating
 in head-tracked mode, or when the Canvas3D's window eyepoint
 policy is set to a value other than the default setting of
 RELATIVE_TO_FIELD_OF_VIEW.</LI><P>
 <LI>Front clip distance - specifies the distance away from the
 clip origin, specified by the front clip policy variable, in
 the direction of gaze where objects stop disappearing. Objects
 closer than the clip origin (eye or screen)
 plus the front clip distance are not drawn. Measurements are
 done in the space (physical or virtual) that is specified by
 the associated front clip policy parameter.</LI><P>
 <LI>Back clip distance - specifies the distance away from the
 clip origin (specified by the back clip policy variable) in the
 direction of gaze where objects begin disappearing. Objects
 farther away from the clip origin (eye or
 screen) plus the back clip distance are not drawn.
 Measurements are done in the space (physical or virtual) that
 is specified by the associated back clip policy
 parameter. The View object's back clip distance is ignored
 if the scene graph contains an active Clip leaf node.</LI><P>
 There are several considerations to take into account when
 choosing values for the front and back clip distances.<P>
 <UL>
 <LI>The front clip distance must be greater than 0.0 in physical
 eye coordinates.</LI><P>
 <LI>The front clipping plane must be in front of the back clipping
 plane, that is, the front clip distance must be less than the
 back clip distance in physical eye coordinates.</LI><P>
 <LI>The front and back clip distances, in physical eye coordinates,
 must be less than the largest positive single-precision floating
 point value, Float.MAX_VALUE. In practice, since these physical
 eye coordinate distances are in meters, the values
 should be much less than that.</LI><P>
 <LI>The ratio of the back distance divided by the front distance,
 in physical eye coordinates, affects Z-buffer precision. This ratio
 should be less than about 3000 to accommodate 16-bit Z-buffers.
 Values of 100 to less than 1000 will produce better results.</LI><P>
 </UL>
 Violating any of the above rules will result in undefined behavior.
 In many cases, no picture will be drawn.<P>
 </UL>
 <b>Frame Start Time, Duration, and Number</b><P>

 There are five methods used to get information about system
 execution and performance:<P>
 <UL>
 <code>getCurrentFrameStartTime</code> returns the time at which
 the most recent rendering frame started.<P>
 <code>getLastFrameDuration</code> returns the duration, in milliseconds, of
 the most recently completed rendering frame.<P>
 <code>getFrameNumber</code> returns the frame number for this view.<P>
 <code>getMaxFrameStartTimes</code> retrieves the implementation-dependent
 maximum number of frames whose start times will be recorded by
 the system.<P>
 <code>getFrameStartTimes</code> copies the last k frame start time values
 into the user-specified array.<P>
 </UL>
 <b>View Traversal and Behavior Scheduling</b><P>
 The following methods control the traversal, the rendering, and
 the execution of the behavior scheduler for this view:<P>
 <UL>
 <code>startBehaviorScheduler</code> starts the behavior scheduler
 running after it has been stopped.<P>
 <code>stopBehaviorScheduler</code> stops the behavior scheduler after all
 currently-scheduled behaviors are executed.<P>
 <code>isBehaviorSchedulerRunning</code> retrieves a flag that indicates
 whether the behavior scheduler is currently running.<P>
 <code>startView</code> starts traversing this view and starts the renderers
 associated with all canvases attached to this view.<P>
 <code>stopView</code> stops traversing this view after the current state of
 the scene graph is reflected on all canvases attached to this
 view.<P>
 <code>isViewRunning</code> returns a flag indicating whether the traverser
 is currently running on this view.<P>
 </UL>
 Note: The above six methods are heavy-weight methods intended
 for verification and image capture (recording). They are not
 intended to be used for flow control.<P>

 <b>Scene Antialiasing</b><P>

 The following methods set and retrieve the scene antialiasing
 flag. Scene antialiasing is either enabled or disabled for this
 view. If enabled, the entire scene will be antialiased on each
 canvas in which scene antialiasing is available. Scene
 antialiasing is disabled by default.<P>
 <UL>
 <code>setSceneAntialiasingEnable</code> sets the scene antialiasing flag.<P>
 <code>getSceneAntialiasingEnable</code> returns the scene antialiasing
 flag.<P>
 </UL>
 Note that line and point antialiasing are independent of scene
 antialiasing. If antialiasing is enabled for lines and points,
 the lines and points will be antialiased prior to scene antialiasing.
 If scene antialiasing is disabled, antialiased lines and points will
 still be antialiased.
 <p>
 <b>Note:</b> Scene antialiasing is ignored in pure immediate mode,
 but is supported in mixed-immediate mode.
 <p>
 <b>Depth Buffer</b><P>

 The following two methods enable and disable automatic freezing
 of the depth buffer for objects rendered during the transparent
 rendering pass (that is, objects rendered using alpha blending)
 for this view. If enabled, depth buffer writes are disabled
 during the transparent rendering pass regardless of the value
 of the depth-buffer-write-enable flag in the RenderingAttributes
 object for a particular node. This flag is enabled by default.<P>
 <UL>
 <code>setDepthBufferFreezeTransparent</code> enables depth buffer freezing.<P>
 <code>getDepthBufferFreezeTransparent</code> retrieves the depth buffer
 flag.<P>
 </UL>
 Transparent objects include BLENDED transparent primitives
 and antialiased lines
 and points. Transparent objects do not include opaque objects
 or primitives rendered with SCREEN_DOOR transparency.<p>

 <b>Sensors</b><P>

 The following methods retrieve the sensor's location in the
 virtual world:<P>
 <UL>
 <code>getSensorToVworld</code> takes the sensor's last reading and
 generates a sensor-to-vworld coordinate system transform. This
 Transform3D object takes points in that sensor's local coordinate
 system and transforms them into virtual world coordinates.<P>

 <code>getSensorHotSpotInVworld</code> retrieves the specified sensor's
 last hotspot location in virtual world coordinates.<P>
 </UL>

 <b>Compatibility Mode</b><P>

 A camera-based view model allows application programmers to think
 about the images displayed on the computer screen as if a virtual
 camera took those images. Such a view model allows application
 programmers to position and orient a virtual camera within a
 virtual scene, to manipulate some parameters of the virtual
 camera's lens (specify its field of view), and to specify the
 locations of the near and far clipping planes.<P>
 Java 3D allows applications to enable compatibility mode for
 room-mounted, non-head-tracked display environments, or to disable
 compatibility mode using the following methods. Camera-based
 viewing functions are only available in compatibility mode.<P>
 <UL>
 <code>setCompatibilityModeEnable</code> turns compatibility mode on or off.
 Compatibility mode is disabled by default.<P>
 <code>getCompatabilityModeEnable</code> returns the compatibility mode
 enable flag.<P>
 </UL>
 Use of these view-compatibility functions will disable some of
 Java 3D's view model features and limit the portability of Java
 3D programs. These methods are primarily intended to help
 jump-start porting of existing applications.<P>

 Setting the Viewing Transform<P>

 The View object provides the following compatibility-mode
 methods that operate on the viewing transform.<P>
 <UL>
 <code>setVpcToEc</code> a compatibility mode method that
 specifies the ViewPlatform
 coordinates (VPC) to eye coordinates viewing transform.<P>
 <code>getVpcToEc</code> returns the VPC.<P>
 </UL>
 Setting the Projection Transform
 <p>
 The View object provides the following compatibility-mode
 methods that operate on the projection transform:<P>
 <UL>
 The <code>setLeftProjection</code> and <code>setRightProjection</code>
 methods specify
 a viewing frustum for the left and right eye that transforms
 points in eye coordinates to clipping coordinates.<P>

 The <code>getLeftProjection</code> and <code>getRightProjection</code>
 methods return
 the viewing frustum for the left and right eye.<P>
 </UL>

 <LI>RELATIVE_TO_SCREEN, Java 3D should interpret the

 <LI>RELATIVE_TO_WINDOW, Java 3D should interpret the

 the Z value is taken from the canvas eyepoint position.

 <LI>RELATIVE_TO_FIELD_OF_VIEW, Java 3D should

 of view (the view frustum will change whenever the application
 program changes the field of view).
 </LI>
 <LI>RELATIVE_TO_COEXISTENCE, Java 3D should interpret the eye's
 position in coexistence coordinates. In this mode, the eye position
 is taken from the view (rather than the Canvas3D) and transformed from
 coexistence coordinates to image plate coordinates for each

 <li>The front clipping plane must be in front of the

 <li>The front and back clip distances, in physical
 eye coordinates, must be less than the largest positive
 single-precision floating point value, <code>Float.MAX_VALUE</code>.
 In practice, since these physical eye coordinate distances are in
 meters, the values should be <i>much</i> less than that.
 <li>The ratio of the back distance divided by the front distance,
 in physical eye coordinates, affects Z-buffer precision. This
 ratio should be less than about 3000 in order to accommodate 16-bit
 Z-buffers. Values of 100 to less than 1000 will produce better
